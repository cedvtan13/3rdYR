## Overview

This project implements a **multi-process HTTP proxy server** in C for Linux systems. The proxy server acts as an intermediary between HTTP clients (web browsers, curl, etc.) and web servers, forwarding requests and responses while providing detailed logging of all transactions.

### Key Objectives
- Handle multiple concurrent client connections using `fork()`
- Parse and forward HTTP requests to destination servers
- Relay server responses back to clients
- Provide comprehensive logging and error handling
- Support standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD, CONNECT)

---

## System Architecture

```
[Client] ←→ [Proxy Server] ←→ [Target Server]
           (Port 8080-9999)     (Port 80/443/etc.)
```

### Process Model
- **Parent Process**: Listens for incoming connections and manages child processes
- **Child Processes**: Handle individual client connections (one per client)
- **Signal Handling**: Cleans up zombie processes and handles graceful shutdown

### Data Flow
1. Client connects to proxy server
2. Proxy accepts connection and forks child process
3. Child process receives HTTP request from client
4. Child parses request to extract target host/port/path
5. Child connects to target server
6. Child forwards original request to target server
7. Child relays server response back to client
8. Child process terminates and is cleaned up

---

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Request Parsing (`parse_request`)
- Extracts HTTP method, host, port, and path from raw HTTP requests
- Supports both absolute URLs (`http://example.com/path`) and relative paths with Host header
- Handles default port assignment (80 for HTTP)

#### 2. Server Connection (`connect_to_server`)
- Uses `getaddrinfo()` for robust hostname resolution
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (future-ready)
- Implements proper error handling and resource cleanup

#### 3. Data Forwarding (`forward_data`)
- Efficiently transfers data between client and server sockets
- Handles partial sends to ensure complete data transmission
- Provides transfer statistics and logging

#### 4. Process Management
- Uses `fork()` for concurrent client handling
- Implements `SIGCHLD` handler to prevent zombie processes
- Provides graceful shutdown via `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C)

### Data Structures

```c
typedef struct {
    char method[16];      // HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
    char host[256];       // Target hostname
    int port;             // Target port number
    char path[512];       // Request path
    int is_valid;         // Validation flag
} HttpRequest;
```

## Compilation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install build tools (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Compilation
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ~/3rdYR/CPE-3106_OS

# Compile the proxy server
gcc -Wall -o proxy_server proxy_server.c

# Make executable (if needed)
chmod +x proxy_server
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check compilation success
ls -la proxy_server

# Should show executable file with proper permissions
```

---

## Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Basic Functionality Test

#### Start the Proxy Server
```bash
./proxy_server 8080
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Simple HTTP Proxy Server (Linux) ===
✓ Proxy server listening on port 8080
✓ Configure your browser to use 127.0.0.1:8080 as HTTP proxy
✓ Press Ctrl+C to stop the server

Waiting for client connection...
```

#### Test with curl
```bash
# In a new terminal window
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://example.com
```

**Expected Server Output:**
```
✓ Client #1 connected from 127.0.0.1:XXXXX

=== Handling Client (PID: XXXXX) ===
Received XXX bytes from client
=== Parsed Request ===
Method: GET
Host: example.com
Port: 80
Path: /
Connecting to example.com:80...
✓ Connected to example.com:80 successfully!
Forwarding request to server...
Forwarding data server->client...
Forwarded XXXX bytes server->client
✓ Client handled successfully!
```

**Expected Client Output:**
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
    ...
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Example Domain</h1>
        <p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples...</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Test 2: Multiple Concurrent Connections

#### Terminal 1: Start Proxy
```bash
./proxy_server 8080
```

#### Terminal 2: Multiple curl requests
```bash
# Test concurrent connections
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://httpbin.org/get &
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://example.com &
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://google.com &
wait
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Multiple child processes created simultaneously
- Each client gets unique process ID
- All requests processed concurrently
- Parent process continues listening

### Test 3: Browser Configuration Test

#### Configure Browser Proxy
1. **Firefox**: Settings → Network Settings → Manual proxy configuration
2. **Chrome**: Settings → Advanced → System → Open proxy settings
3. Set HTTP proxy to: `127.0.0.1:8080`

#### Browse Websites
- Visit `http://example.com`
- Visit `http://httpbin.org`
- Check proxy server logs for activity

### Test 4: Error Handling Test

#### Invalid Hostname Test
```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://nonexistent-website-12345.com
```

**Expected Output:**
```
getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known
Failed to connect to server
```

#### Port Already in Use Test
```bash
# Start first instance
./proxy_server 8080 &

# Try to start second instance on same port
./proxy_server 8080
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Failed to bind socket: Address already in use
Port 8080 may already be in use
```

### Test 5: Performance Test

#### Load Testing with Multiple Requests
```bash
# Create a simple load test script
for i in {1..10}; do
    curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://httpbin.org/get &
done
wait
```

**Monitor:**
- Process creation/cleanup
- Memory usage: `ps aux | grep proxy_server`
- File descriptors: `lsof -p <proxy_pid>`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Address already in use" Error
**Problem:** Port is already occupied
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 8080

# Kill existing process or use different port
./proxy_server 8081
```

#### 2. "Permission denied" Error
**Problem:** Trying to bind to privileged port (< 1024)
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use non-privileged port
./proxy_server 8080  # Instead of port 80
```

#### 3. Compilation Errors
**Problem:** Missing headers or libraries
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install development packages
sudo apt install build-essential libc6-dev

# Check compiler version
gcc --version
```

#### 4. Connection Timeouts
**Problem:** Firewall or network restrictions
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status

# Test local connectivity
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://127.0.0.1:8080  # Should fail gracefully
```

### Debugging Tips

#### Enable Detailed Logging
- Monitor system calls: `strace -f ./proxy_server 8080`
- Check network traffic: `tcpdump -i lo port 8080`
- Monitor processes: `watch 'ps aux | grep proxy'`

#### Memory Leak Detection
```bash
# Compile with debug info
gcc -g -Wall -o proxy_server proxy_server.c

# Run with valgrind
valgrind --leak-check=full ./proxy_server 8080
```
